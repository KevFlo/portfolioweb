#Still working on some stuff

Well work has been heavy learning lots on linux administrating and dealing with engineers and scientist.
They are ... interesting to say the least.

Lots has changed since last I posted. Got a wonderful girl, promotion and a car! 

I can finally start doing cool camping trips, in fact I went to SF, Joshua Tree and Rowher Flats.
Its been one hell of a trip, I loved every second of it. My girl loves skiing so, I fell in love with it too.


Tech wise, I have limited control of my network so my clusters and hosting has been put on pause, my NAS is still being built. 
I am using unraid to control my storage, mainly as backups and for images videos and games. 
My hope is to connect it to my clusters as a database and eventually migrate to self hosted everything.

Need more money for that though, so yeah gotta work more :D .

Thats it for now. Snek2snek is working pretty well I am adding new features and working on my software dev frelance website.
I've been contracted to make a app for ios and android. I'll document that as I make more progress for now I set up Android studio and am working on learning android stuido dev.
