<h1>Well Shit!</h1>
Main drive borked itself, luckly I had done a back up before it happened.
Unfortuantely, I still had to wipe the hardrive clean, which means I have to re-download everything.
I am now running Manjaro Linux -i3. I did like the sway flavours look. I might migrate. 

setting up the GPU drivers to no me lacking in performance in games has been a challenge,
so was getting the audio working, still need to figure out how to stream my "windows" audio stream on discord.

Still setting up my dev envirnoment. I like Allacrity so far.

I miss my bird, cant wait to have enough to move some where cheaper and find some plot of land.
